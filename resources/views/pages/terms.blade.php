                <h1>Terms of service</h1>

                <div class="box-compressed-md">
                    <p>
                        Please read these Terms of Service. These Terms define the conditions of Whir.to (further
                        &quot;Whir&quot;) use. Use of the Whir service, visiting the website, and sending bitcoin
                        anonymously signifies your acceptance of and agreement to these Terms. Whir reserves the
                        right to update these Terms at any moment by posting revised terms on the website. Such
                        changes take effect from the date of their posting on the website. </p>


                    <h2>1. BTC and Whir</h2>
                    <p><strong>1.1 Information on the BTC network</strong></p>
                    <p>Our Service does not send or receive money independently; we only organize the interaction
                        within the BTC network according to the conditions that you specify.</p>
                    <p>Once the BTC network identifies the information on the transaction you have sent, the
                        information is transmitted to other users and companies in the BTC network.</p>
                    <p>The Service cannot be used to terminate BTC transactions or recover money.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2 BTC risks</strong></p>
                    <p>Whir has no control over and makes no representations as to BTC network security. You
                        acknowledge that the use of the BTC network entails a risk. We cannot hold ourselves
                        responsible for lost profits.</p>
                    <p>The BTC transaction can remain unconfirmed during a certain period (usually less than an
                        hour but occasionally up to several days). It can never be completed if it remains
                        "unconfirmed."</p>
                    <p><strong>1.3 Working arrangements of the Whir service with end customers</strong></p>
                    <p>The Service organizes a non-public transfer from a generated deposit address to the recipient
                        address. The Service is not liable for any operation beyond the scope described on its
                        website or these Terms. These include undue sending of BTC to the service address,
                        resending, or delay in confirmation of your transaction.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.4 Your passwords and security</strong></p>
                    <p>Whir has no access to your BTC wallets which you used for sending or receiving of
                        cryptocurrencies. Consequently, all the responsibility for the use of your wallets lies with
                        you. Should you need any consultation on irregularity, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.5 The minimum age for the use of the Service</strong></p>
                    <p>You must be older than 18 years or be of the minimum age required by the current legislation
                        to use the Whir service.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.6 Taxes</strong></p>
                    <p>Taxes are your sole responsibility. You must find out whether BTC or cryptocurrency
                        operations are subject to tax regulations of your region. All issues related to reporting to
                        taxation bodies and taxpaying entirely lie with you. Whir is not responsible for such issues
                        and does not provide consultations on taxation questions, which may arise as a result of
                        executed operations.</p>

                        <li>spamming, pyramid schemes, or any other activity duplicating unwanted messages should
